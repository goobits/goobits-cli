# Shared Components for Goobits CLI

This directory contains shared patterns and components extracted from the multi-language CLI implementations.

## Structure

- **analysis/**: Pattern analysis tools and reports
- **schemas/**: Shared schema definitions (Phase 2)
- **components/**: Reusable components (Phase 3)

## Phase 2: Pattern Extraction

### Week 7: Foundation & Analysis
- Pattern identification across all 4 languages
- Categorization for parallel extraction
- Boundary definition for safe parallel work

### Week 8: Parallel Extraction (Upcoming)
- Agent A: Code Structure Patterns
- Agent B: Operational Patterns
- Agent C: Documentation Patterns
- Agent D: Test Patterns

## Principles

1. Only extract patterns that exist in ALL 4 languages
2. Preserve language-specific idioms
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Focus on reducing duplication without forcing uniformity
