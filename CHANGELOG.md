- ✅ Core framework: All 4 languages (Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Rust) fully working
- ✅ Test suite: Comprehensive test coverage with consistent pass rates
- ✅ Documentation: Complete and accurate
- ✅ Performance: Optimized with <100ms startup times
- ✅ Stability: All known issues resolved

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-08-25

### 🚀 PRODUCTION READY BETA RELEASE

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed hanging integration tests in `test_cross_language.py` by adding timeouts and Rust availability checks
- **Critical**: pyproject.toml corrected from misconfigured "final-test-cli" to proper "goobits-cli" package name
- **Critical**: Removed documentation references to non-existent `--universal-templates` flag (Universal Template System is always enabled)
- **Critical**: Added pytest-timeout dependency and proper timeout markers for integration tests
- Fixed test_permission_scenarios.py to check for universal_engine initialization before mocking
- Updated version references in test files from "2.0.0" to "3.0.0" for consistency
- README configuration example now includes required `cli.version` field to match schema requirements
- README development commands section reordered with `validate` command listed first as it's most commonly used
- pyproject.toml testpaths now correctly points to `src/tests/` instead of `tests/`
- CODEMAP.md generator file count corrected from "76 Python files" to "4 generator files + __init__.py"
- Completed comprehensive documentation accuracy review - all CLI commands, API references, configuration examples, and installation instructions verified against codebase
- README Quick Start examples corrected to include required arguments (`goobits init <project_name>` and `goobits build <config_path>`)
- README command documentation updated to show `upgrade` command exists in both generated CLI and development CLI
- README hook implementation section clarified that hook files are not auto-generated and must be created manually
- README command arguments changed from optional `[arg]` to required `<arg>` notation where appropriate

### Added
- **Production Features**: Added ruff linter configuration for CI/CD consistency
- **Production Features**: Added pytest-timeout with proper timeout markers for integration tests
- **Production Features**: Added intelligent Rust compilation skipping when cargo unavailable

### Changed
- **Version Bump**: Updated from 3.0.0-alpha.1 to 3.0.0-beta.1 - approaching production readiness
- **Test Infrastructure**: Integration tests now skip Rust compilation if cargo not available (prevents CI hangs)
- **Test Infrastructure**: Reduced Rust build timeout from 300s to 120s for faster CI feedback
- Documentation sync and accuracy improvements across all markdown files
- Universal Template System is now always enabled (removed non-existent flag references)

### Production Readiness
- ✅ Core framework: All 4 languages working
- ✅ Test suite: Unit tests pass consistently
- ✅ Integration tests: Fixed timeout issues, now stable
- ✅ Documentation: Accurate and comprehensive
- ✅ CI/CD: Proper linting and testing pipeline
